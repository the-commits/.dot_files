* Nerd Fonts corrects some issues of the font
* The font is based on _Comic Shanns v1_ by Shannon Miwa (https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns)
* The **Bold** weight has been manually added by Nerd Fonts, inspired by Thai Pangsakulyanont's _Comic Mono_ (https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font)
