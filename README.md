## Structured commit messages
The Structured Commit Message Approach is a method for composing informative and organized commit messages. It involves dividing the commit message into distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose:
```text
    Purpose: Describes the reason for the changes made in the commit.
    Outcome: Lists the specific modifications introduced by the commit.
    Context: Provides background information or context relevant to the changes.
    Approach: Outlines the steps taken to implement the changes and any notable considerations.
```
By following this approach, commit messages become more detailed, consistent, and informative, aiding in project documentation and collaboration.
