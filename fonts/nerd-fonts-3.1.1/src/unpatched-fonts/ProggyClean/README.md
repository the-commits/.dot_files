# Proggy Clean

http://www.proggyfonts.net/

For more information have a look at the upstream website: https://github.com/bluescan/proggyfonts

The ProggyClean.ttf contains the Latin-1 character set (ISO 8859-1 I think).

The ProggyCleanCE.ttf can be used for the Czech language, but I assume it's just
Latin-2.

_This font is rather old and there seems to be a 2019 update named Proggy Vector. Is there any interest?_
